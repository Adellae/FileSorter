# Project Overview
This project is a file sorter script designed to organize files in the Downloads folder. It categorizes files based on their types into subdirectories such as Images, Videos, Documents, Executables, and Others.

- **sorter**: Contains the core functionality for sorting files.
- **config**: Houses configuration files, including user_defined_path.txt.
- **main.py**: The main entry point for running the file sorter script.

## Configuration
The user_defined_path.txt file in the config directory stores the user-defined path for the Downloads folder. If the file doesn't exist, the script creates it and uses the default path (C:\\Users\\<username>\\Downloads).
